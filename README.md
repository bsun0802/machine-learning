# Common Machine Learning Model Implementation from Scratch
bos@usc.edu

## Usage
Use `Andconda` python, pip and jupyter notebook.
run `pip install -r requirements` to download all modules that are used in this project.
run `python setup.py` to make sure that all modules could be imported properly.
### The top folder contains implementation of popular machine learning models. 

Run `main.ipynb`. To walk through machine-learning work flow, e.g., split train&test data, bulid and train the model,
cross-validation, tuning parameters, etc. 

### The sub-directories are well-konwn dataset and problems in machine learning field.
My practice on solving those problems with *scikit-learn* :shipit:. 
Run `main.ipynb` in each subdirectory to see the work flow.
