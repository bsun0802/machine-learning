# Common Machine Learning Model Implementation from Scratch
bos@usc.edu

## Usage

### The top folder contains implementation of popular machine learning models. 

To check all will-be-imported packages are ready-to-go, run `setup.py`

To walk through machine-learning work flow, e.g., split train&test data, bulid and train the model,
cross-validation, tuning parameters, etc. Run `main.ipynb`

### The sub-directories are well-konwn dataset and problems in machine learning field.
Of my practice on solving those problems with *scikit-learn*.
